# Mission

Our mission is to develop enticing, complete, and refreshing games in an oversaturated game market. Delivering  replay-able, classic, and creative games for all.

# Vision

We are a beacon for the soulless, the lost and meandering. Our vision is to build a brand and game studio that all are welcome at, and all want to work at. While we begin with simple games focused on the mobile market, we want to build the next game-breaking studio from the ground up. 

We embrace creativity, vision, and passion - if you can think it, we’re on board with building a project out of it. Nothing it out of bounds for us, and we hope we can bring that mainstream to one day deliver truly breathtaking games of AAA quality, rivaling and surpassing even the most beloved games of today.

# Values

- **Creativity** - what is a good game if not for the creative minds behind it? Is it possible to create games where creativity is absent? Probably, but we’re not interested in that. Imagine anything you can, and deliver on it.
- **Vision -** ideas are the foundation of innovation. Have a ground breaking or truly earth shattering feature or idea? Show us the vision and we’ll make it happen.
- **Passion** - one of the foundations of a start-up company is truly having a passion for what you’re doing. Where there’s passion, quality will follow. Show your passion in your work.
- **Fun** - we don’t want to be just another game company, just another place to work, or just another career. We want to have fun with what we’re doing, otherwise why the hell are we doing it? If its not fun, maybe we should just do the bare minimums at a corporate job somewhere until we die.
